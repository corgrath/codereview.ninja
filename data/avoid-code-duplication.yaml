    ## Why is it considered bad
    Duplicated code increases the mainttenence costs as the same bug can appear in several places.
    It also increases the effort required in order to apply the same change in several places.
    ## How it can happen
    It is usually caused by developers copying and pasting code, usually because they are in a hurry and rather than taking (or getting) the time to refactor the code properely.
    Another common cause is if developers work in a large code base, they usually forget what has already been implemented over time.
